# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-08)

**Core value:** Installation and client access must be as simple as commercial VPN providers. If it requires more than "curl | bash" to set up or more than "login and download" to get a working VPN config, it's too complex.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 — Docker Prerequisites & Host Setup (v1.1 milestone)
